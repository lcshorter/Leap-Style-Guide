<h1>Detailed Interaction Description</h1>
<h2>Checkbox</h2>
<p>Checkboxes allow a user to make multiple selections. They are also used as a boolean selector when a user needs to opt into a selection, such as “remember password”, “agree to terms and conditions”, etc. This is in contrast to switches where the default boolean state is “off”.</p>
