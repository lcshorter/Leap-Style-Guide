<h2 id="gray-palette" class="data">Gray Palette</h2>
<p class="leap-font-medium" style="padding-bottom: 24px">The gray palette is intended to be used holistically throughout the app. It should be implemented in text as well as used as panel and element background colors.</p>
<p class="leap-font-medium" style="padding-bottom: 24px">Consistency in the building blocks of the Leap Platform will give the apps a unified and predictable feel. Use of these grays should be universal through all apps.</p>

<h2 id="reserved-colors">Reserved Colors</h2>
<p class="leap-font-medium" style="padding-bottom: 24px">Reserved colors are intended to be used as indicators of states. These colors should signify a consistency to a user; when they see one of theses colors it should be immediately clear what it is trying to convey to them.</p>
<p class="leap-font-medium" style="padding-bottom: 24px">It is also important to remember that a Brand Color (discussed below) that is too close to one of the reserved colors is a common problem of design systems, be cautious of that.</p>
<p class="leap-font-medium" style="padding-bottom: 24px">Some apps have introduced colors that indicate app-specific states such as the Concert Review / Rejected / Approved colors. ** we will review these instances and figure out how to align on them.</p>
