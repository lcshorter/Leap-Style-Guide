<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
<p>The User Settings Menu provides access to information and options that are global in nature and relate directly to the current user.  The menu should be made accessible from a single location in the global navigation. The following basic information should always appear in the User Settings Menu:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Avatar</li>
	<li>First and last name</li>
	<li>Email address (sign-in)</li>
	<li>My Apps link</li>
	<li>Sign Out option (this option should always appear last)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional items may be included, depending on the need of the app.  Like the base items, app-specific information and options should reflect the global context of the app.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use">When to Use</h2>
<ul>
<li>This pattern should be used in all LEAP apps to provide access to global user options and profile information</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-not-to-use">When Not to Use</h2>
<ul>
<li>This pattern should be used only in the global context.  This User Settings Menu should not be displayed as a result of clicking a user avatar in a data grid, or user list.</li>
</ul>
